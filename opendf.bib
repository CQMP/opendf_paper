abstract = {We present release 1.3 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, an international open-source software project to develop libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion systems. Development is centered on common XML and binary data formats, on libraries to simplify and speed up code development, and on full-featured simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), as well as the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). Changes in the new release include a DMRG program for interacting models, support for translation symmetries in the diagonalization programs, the ability to define custom measurement operators, and support for inhomogeneous systems, such as lattice models with traps. The software is available from our web server at http://alps.comp-phys.org/.},

abstract = {We present release 2.0 of the ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations) project, an open source software project to develop libraries and application programs for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum lattice models such as quantum magnets, lattice bosons, and strongly correlated fermion systems. The code development is centered on common XML and HDF5 data formats, libraries to simplify and speed up code development, common evaluation and plotting tools, and simulation programs. The programs enable non-experts to start carrying out serial or parallel numerical simulations by providing basic implementations of the important algorithms for quantum lattice models: classical and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) using non-local updates, extended ensemble simulations, exact and full diagonalization (ED), the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) both in a static version and a dynamic time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) code, and quantum Monte Carlo solvers for dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The ALPS libraries provide a powerful framework for programmers to develop their own applications, which, for instance, greatly simplify the steps of porting a serial code onto a parallel, distributed memory machine. Major changes in release 2.0 include the use of HDF5 for binary data, evaluation tools in Python, support for the Windows operating system, the use of CMake as build system and binary installation packages for Mac OS X and Windows, and integration with the VisTrails workflow provenance tool.

abstract = {In this paper, we show how the two-particle Green function can be obtained within the framework of the dual fermion approach. This facilitates the calculation of the susceptibility in strongly correlated systems where long-ranged nonlocal correlations cannot be neglected. We formulate the Bethe–Salpeter equations for the full vertex in the particle-particle and particle-hole channels and introduce an approximation for practical calculations. The scheme is applied to the two-dimensional Hubbard model at half-filling. The spin-spin susceptibility is found to strongly increase for the wave vector q=($\pi$,$\pi$), which indicates the antiferromagnetic instability. We find a suppression of the critical temperature compared to the mean-field result due to the incorporation of the nonlocal spin fluctuations.},

@article{Hafermann2013a,
abstract = {Strongly correlated quantum impurity problems appear in a wide variety of contexts ranging from nanoscience and surface physics to material science and the theory of strongly correlated lattice models, where they appear as auxiliary systems within dynamical mean-field theory. Accurate and unbiased solutions must usually be obtained numerically, and continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithms, a family of algorithms based on the stochastic sampling of partition function expansions, perform well for such systems. With the present paper we provide an efficient and generic implementation of the hybridization expansion quantum impurity solver, based on the segment representation. We provide a complete implementation featuring most of the recently developed extensions and optimizations. Our implementation allows one to treat retarded interactions and provides generalized measurement routines based on improved estimators for the self-energy and for vertex functions. The solver is embedded in the ALPS-DMFT application package.

Computer: Desktop PC, high-performance computers. Operating system: Unix, Linux, OSX, Windows. Has the code been vectorized or parallelized?: Yes, MPI parallelized. RAM: 1 GB Classification: 7.3. External routines: ALPS [1, 2, 3], BLAS [4, 5], LAPACK [6], HDF5 [7] Nature of problem: Quantum impurity models were originally introduced to describe a magnetic transition metal ion in a non-magnetic host metal. They are widely used today. In nanoscience they serve as representations of quantum dots and molecular conductors. In condensed matter physics, they are playing an increasingly important role in the description of strongly correlated electron materials, where the complicated many-body problem is mapped onto an auxiliary quantum impurity model in the context of dynamical mean-field theory, and its cluster and diagrammatic extensions. They still constitutes a non-trivial many-body problem, which takes into account the (possibly retarded) interaction between electrons occupying the impurity site. Electrons are allowed to dynamically hop on and off the impurity site, which is described by a time-dependent hybridization function. Solution method: The quantum impurity model is solved using a continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo algorithm which is based on a perturbation expansion of the partition function in the impurity–bath hybridization. Monte Carlo configurations are represented as segments on the imaginary time interval and individual terms correspond to Feynman diagrams which are stochastically sampled to all orders using a Metropolis algorithm. For a detailed review on the method, we refer the reader to [8]. Running time: 1–8 h. References:[1]B. Bauer, L. D. Carr, H. G. Evertz, A. Feiguin, J. Freire, S. Fuchs, L. Gamper, J. Gukelberger, E.

This approach contains the important local correlations of DMFT, giving, among others, rise to quasiparticle renormalizations, Mott-Hubbard transitions and magnetism, but also non-local correlations beyond. The latter are at the very essence of many physical phenomena in strongly correlated elecectron systems. As correlations are treated equally on all length scales, D\^{I}“A allows us to describe physical phenomena such as magnons, quantum criticality, and the interplay between antiferromagnetism and superconductivity.

abstract = {We present an efficient diagrammatic method to describe nonlocal correlation effects in lattice fermion Hubbard-type models, which is based on a change of variables in the Grassmann path integrals. The new fermions are dual to the original ones and correspond to weakly interacting quasiparticles in the case of strong local correlations in the Hubbard model. The method starts with dynamical mean-field theory as a zeroth-order approximation and includes nonlocal effects in a perturbative way. In contrast to cluster approaches, this method utilizes an exact transition to a dual set of variables. It therefore becomes possible to treat vertices of an effective single-impurity problem as small parameters. This provides a very efficient interpolation between bandlike weak-coupling and atomic limits. The method is illustrated on the two-dimensional Hubbard model. The antiferromagnetic pseudogap, Fermi-arc formations, and non-Fermi-liquid effects due to the Van Hove singularity are correctly reproduced by the lowest-order diagrams. Extremum properties of the dual fermion approach are discussed in terms of the Feynman variational principle.},

abstract = {Using the perturbation theory with the Coulomb correlation as the expansion parameter we show that for ∞-dimensional systems the uniform and antiferromagnetic susceptibility, the charge susceptibility and the pair correlation function in the s and the extended s channel reduce to a product of local quantities. For systems on finite-dimensional lattices the perturbation expansion allows the evaluation of the 1/D corrections.},
